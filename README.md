# Color Generator Plugin for Micro

**Color Generator** is a fun plugin for the
[micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/) text editor that randomly generates
a new 16-color colorscheme each time you run the command.

See [help/colorgen.md](help/colorgen.md) for more details.

## Installation

Place the plugin folder in `~/.config/micro/plug/colorgen/`, or clone it
directly from the GitHub repository:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/micro/plug
git clone https://github.com/akikareha/micro-colorgen-plugin ~/.config/micro/plug/colorgen
```

Alternatively, this plugin is also available through the unofficial plugin
channel:  
https://github.com/akikareha/micro-unofficial-plugin-channel  
You can install it by adding the channel and then using `plugin install`.
